The uploaded notebook contains a predictive analysis using various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) for regression. Here's a general description you can include in the README file on GitHub:

KC House Predictive Analysis

This notebook focuses on predictive analysis using different machine learning techniques. The project involves creating, training, and evaluating regression models to predict target variables based on historical data. Key features of the code include:

- Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, data normalization, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Regression Models:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM): The SVM model is used for regression to predict the target variable. The model's hyperparameters (e.g., kernel type, C, epsilon) are tuned for optimal performance.
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) Evaluation:** The performance of the SVM model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which indicates the model's prediction accuracy.
- Model Evaluation: The notebook prints the evaluation metric (MSE) for assessing the performance of the predictive model.

This tool is useful for those interested in predictive modeling and regression analysis using machine learning methods.
